# SEGMIND NPM - Generate Images with Ease

## Overview

Segmind NPM is a powerful package that allows you to effortlessly generate images using state-of-the-art models from Segmind's cloud platform. With this package, you can easily integrate image generation capabilities into your applications, websites, or projects. This markdown provides you with a step-by-step guide on how to use Segmind NPM to create stunning images.

## Installation

To get started, you need to import the `segmind-npm` package into your project. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install segmind-npm
# or
yarn add segmind-npm
```

## Initializing the API Key

Before you can generate images, you'll need an API key from [cloud.segmind.com](https://cloud.segmind.com). This key will grant you access to Segmind's powerful image generation models. Replace `"YOUR API-KEY"` with your actual API key in the code below:

```javascript
import { SDXL, SDXLType } from "segmind-npm"

const apiKey = "YOUR API-KEY";
const sdxl = new SDXL(apiKey);
```

## Generating Images

Now that you have initialized the API key, you can generate images with just a few lines of code. Specify your desired image by providing a prompt, and you can also customize various parameters to control the image generation process:

```javascript
sdxl.generate({
  prompt: "a panda on a chair",
  style: "base", // Style of the image
  samples: 1, // Number of samples to generate
  scheduler: "UniPC", // Type of scheduler
  num_inference_steps: 25, // Number of denoising steps
  guidance_scale: 8, // Scale for classifier-free guidance
  strength: 0.2, // Transformation strength
  high_noise_fraction: 0.8, // Fraction of inference steps to run on each expert
  seed: "468685", // Seed for image generation
  img_width: 1024, // Image width
  img_height: 1024, // Image height
  refiner: true, // Improve image quality
  base64: false, // Base64 encoding of the output image
}).then((response) => {
    // Handle the generated image here
    console.log(response.data);
});
```
